This project is research based one for memory retrival for RAG based LLM's
This project is built and maintained by @Ajaysvasan , @don1502

For Building this project you need to have python with version 3.12 or above

The main architecture is in the RAG-TCRL-X

First you need to create a conda environment

If you don't have conda then install it to create the virtual environment

Then use following command to create the conda virtual environment

conda create --name <env-name> python=3.12

This project is built using python 3.12 thus the versioning. If you want to use some of the latest versions out there then some of the dependencies might not work

Once done creating the virtual enviromment use command

conda activate <env-name>

to activate the environment.

Inside the RAG-TCRL-X directory you can find the requirments.txt which contains all the dependencies

Use

pip install -r requirments.txt

to install all the packages

You can also use the bash script (if you are on linux ) or the bat script if you are windows to make the installation easier

Feel free to raise issues and patch them if you can
